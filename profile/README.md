## Unifier Goes Open-Source: Code Released and No Active Maintenance for the Time Being (Effective June 26, 2023)

### What is Unifier?
The name says it all, unifier combines multiple platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and LinkedIn into one feed for ultimate productivity, ease and focus. 

### Why is Unifier no longer maintained by the team?
We were facing challenges due to new API plans from platforms like Twitter and Reddit. As a result, the only viable option for us was to transition into a Mastodon reader, even though it contradicts our objective and has limited demand. Therefore we have decided not to pursue further development and have made our existing work open-source on GitHub. As of June 24, 2023, API functionality, including logging in and using Mastodon, has been disabled.

### I wanna continue on unifier.app
If you have any inquiries or wish to contact us, please feel free to reach out to us via our Discord server at https://discord.gg/SHAWpk5s. You can ping @jecta, who manages the domain, and we will be happy to assist you. We may consider re-engaging with Unifier if you have a compelling idea regarding its future, as our decision to step back was primarily due to financial challenges and the fact that platforms like Twitter no longer support third-party clients.
